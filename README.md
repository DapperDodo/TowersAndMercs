# TowersAndMercs

making an awesome game prototype and learning haxe/openfl at the same time!!

This is an attempt at implementing Terminus: Towers and Mercs in Haxe, using OpenFL.

This is abandonware, I have decided not to go down the Haxe rabbithole. 
Instead I am now implementing this game in Go (Golang).

I am keeping this version on Github because it contains a full implementation of a FogOfWar subsystem.
This was quite a lot of work to design and implement, and I intend to port this to Go.
